# Trading Automation Platform Architecture

This is a comprehensive plan for building a Flask site that acts as an intermediary platform between TradingView and Alpaca for automated trading. The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, and robust, leveraging the strengths of each platform while overcoming their limitations.

## Phase 1: Upstream Signal Generation (TradingView)

This phase focuses on generating trading signals on TradingView and transmitting them to your platform.

**Objective:** Monitor a large number of tickers and send structured trading signals to an external platform.

**Strategy:** Utilize TradingView's server-side Pine Script to monitor tickers and trigger alerts.

### Implementation:

**Ticker Segmentation:** Divide the target tickers (e.g., all 2,400 NYSE tickers) into groups of up to 40 tickers each. This is a hard limit of the Pine Script language. This will require approximately 60 scripts for the entire NYSE.

**Pine Script Development:** For each group, create a separate Pine Script. Each script will:

- Use the `request.security()` function to pull data for its specific list of tickers.
- Include a user-configurable parameter for trading mode (e.g., "Paper" vs. "Production") using `input.string()`.
- Include an input for fixed risk amount (e.g., $100.00) using `input.float()`.
- Contain the core trading logic (your custom strategy).
- Dynamically build a JSON payload containing the signal, ticker, and all relevant parameters, including `tradingMode` and `riskAmount`.

**Alert Configuration:** Manually create a technical alert on a TradingView chart for each of the 60 Pine Scripts.

- Each alert will be configured to send a webhook to a single, specific URL on your Flask site.
- The message body of each alert will be the JSON payload generated by the Pine Script.

## Phase 2: The Core Platform (Flask Site)

This phase involves building the Flask application that receives, processes, and executes the trading signals.

**Objective:** Act as the central brain of the operation, processing signals from TradingView and executing trades on Alpaca.

**Architecture:** A simple, headless Flask application that exposes a single webhook endpoint.

### Implementation:

**Flask Application:** Create a Flask application with a single route (e.g., `/webhook`) that accepts POST requests.

**Webhook Listener:** The route will be designed to listen for incoming webhooks from TradingView.

**JSON Parsing:** When a webhook is received, the application will parse the JSON body to extract the trading signal and all its parameters.

**Conditional Logic:** The platform will use the `tradingMode` parameter to determine the next action.

- If `tradingMode` is "Paper", the platform will use Alpaca's paper trading API keys to execute a simulated trade.
- If `tradingMode` is "Production", the platform will use Alpaca's live trading API keys to execute a real trade.

**Order Execution:** The platform will use the Alpaca API for Python to:

- Calculate the position size based on the `fixedRisk` amount and the trade's stop-loss.
- Place the market or limit order with Alpaca.

**Data Logging:** The platform will log every incoming signal and trade execution to a structured data storage solution (e.g., a database or a file). This data is crucial for the next phase.

## Phase 3: Downstream Analysis (AWS OpenSearch)

This phase focuses on visualizing and analyzing the performance of your automated strategy.

**Objective:** Gain insights into the strategy's performance across different industries and market conditions.

**Architecture:** A dashboarding tool for data visualization.

### Implementation:

**Data Pipeline:** The Flask site will send the structured log entries to an AWS OpenSearch cluster.

**Dashboard Creation:** Using OpenSearch Dashboards, create a visualization suite to monitor your trading activity. This can include:

- A real-time feed of buy/sell signals.
- Charts showing the number of signals generated per industry group.
- Performance metrics (e.g., profit/loss) broken down by ticker or group.

## Summary

The plan leverages each platform's strengths: TradingView for signal generation, your Flask site for business logic, and Alpaca for trade execution. The use of a "paper vs. production" toggle allows for a seamless transition from safe, simulated testing to live trading. This entire system, once set up, can monitor thousands of tickers simultaneously while staying within the limits of your TradingView subscription.
